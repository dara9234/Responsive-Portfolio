      <img src="assets/images/Dara.png" class="auth-image" alt="Darakhshan">

      <p>My name is Darakh, and I am a proud mom of 2 beautiful girls who are turning 10 and 3 this October. My youngest is currently starting school and my oldest is starting to become an independent young lady. Now that my children are getting older and becoming self-sufficient, I am ready to take on new challenges and work to learn, explore, and better myself! For the past few years, I’ve been working part-time and taking online courses while my children have been growing up, and as I’ve started to see my kids needing me less and less, I’ve realized that I can begin to take on new challenges and explore the open horizon!</p>

      <p>For hobbies, I love DIY and crafting, especially with my older daughter, who’s grown into a smart and creative young lady. Being nifty and creating things is one of my favorite feelings, and whenever I get the chance my daughter and I try different projects.</p>

      <p>Professionally, I’ve been a database coordinator, data quality analyst, and microcomputer lab assistant. In total, I’ve worked in the field of databases and data analysis for over a year. I graduated from the Bioinformatics Training Certificate Program (BITMAP) from the University of Illinois at Chicago in 2007 and received a Bachelor of Science in computer science from DePaul University in 2004. </p>
